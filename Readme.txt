This project is for Unicode input in Android device. It supports UTF-16 and UTF-32 charsets.
Specially, I developed this IME to input emoji characters who are mostly encoded in UTF-32.
I took a lot of reference to android SoftKeyboard sample (
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/SoftKeyboard/).

Any bug issues or suggestions, mail to cjtmortimer@gmail.com.
Have a nice day~
